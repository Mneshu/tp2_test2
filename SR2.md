Data Types in Relation to Machine Learning

1. Numerical Data:
   - Example Column: Population
   - Description: Numerical data consists of numbers and can be either continuous or discrete. In machine learning, numerical data is often used as features for        algorithms that require numerical input. It can be subjected to normalization or standardization to bring all values into a similar range.
   - Usage: The 'Population' column contains numerical data representing the population size, which can be used as a feature in predictive models.
