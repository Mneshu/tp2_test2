Time Complexity: O(log n)

- Binary Search divides the search space in half with each iteration, reducing the number of comparisons needed to find the target element.
- The number of iterations required to find the target element is proportional to the logarithm of the size of the search space (n).
- Therefore, the time complexity of Binary Search is O(log n), which represents the maximum number of iterations required to find the target element.

Space Complexity: O(1)

- Binary Search only requires a constant amount of extra memory to store the indices of the search space boundaries.
- The space complexity is O(1) because the amount of extra memory used does not grow with the size of the input (n).

Efficiency in terms of Big-O notation:

- Binary Search has a time complexity of O(log n), which is considered efficient for large datasets.
- The logarithmic time complexity means that the algorithm scales well for large inputs, making it suitable for searching large datasets.
- The constant space complexity (O(1)) indicates that the algorithm uses a fixed amount of extra memory, regardless of the input size, making it space-efficient.
