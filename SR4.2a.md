Binary Search performs faster than Linear Search. The main reason is its logarithmic time complexity, which allows it to handle larger datasets efficiently by reducing the search space by half in each step. However, it requires the list to be sorted, while linear search does not have this requirement.Performance: Binary search is significantly faster than linear search, but it requires the list to be sorted. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list. When to Use: Binary search is ideal for large, sorted lists because it reduces the number of comparisons significantly.
